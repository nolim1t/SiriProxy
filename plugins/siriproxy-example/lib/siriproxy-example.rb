# This is a "hello world" style plugin. It simply intercepts the phrase "text siri proxy" and responds
# with a message about the proxy being up and running (along with a couple other core features). This 
# is good base code for other plugins.
# 
# Remember to add other plugins to the "config.yml" file if you create them!
